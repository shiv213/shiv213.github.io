Playing the Chrome dinosaur game using [NEAT](https://towardsdatascience.com/neat-an-awesome-approach-to-neuroevolution-3eca5cc7930f) (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) genetic evolution.

**Background:**

This is a smaller project I worked on to explore genetic algorithms firsthand. I utilized the [NEAT.js](https://github.com/ExtensionShoe/NEAT-JS) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) libraries.
