**Background:** After picking up inline skating again, I wanted a means to easily compile videos of new tricks and other progress in an interesting manner to post to my [skating instagram](https://instagram.com/shiv.skates/). After finishing the project, I noticed that AutoClip is also useful in compiling highlight clips from video games such as *Valorant* and *CS:GO*.

AutoClip is a Python library that takes in an audio file and several video clips, then creates a montage using the two, syncing the cuts between video clips with the beats in the audio.
