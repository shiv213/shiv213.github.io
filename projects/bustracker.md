**Background:** To help students at my high school locate where their bus is at the end of the day, I created a BusTracking system that allows school admins to store bus locations at the end of the day, at which time every subscribed student gets a text message (via [Twilio](https://twilio.com/)) containing the location of their bus, which can also be viewed from the online portal.
