**Update: There has been a couple efforts made by others on this, so I probably won't continue trying to create this myself from scratch. Here are links to their work:**

[Offline Handwritten Gujarati Character Recognition using Hybrid Classification Technique](https://scholarworks.calstate.edu/downloads/3b591h25p)

[Handwritten Gujarati script recognition with image processing and deep learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8946074)

This project can only accurately perform word segmentation on printed and handwritten Gujarati writing.
