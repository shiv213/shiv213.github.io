Wavetable Synthesizer Generation Utilizing Measurement of Photon Movement in Liquid

**Background:**\
The summer before my junior year, I was accepted into the [Governorâ€™s Honors Program (GHP)](https://gosa.georgia.gov/governors-honors-program) for computer science and engineering and was given the opportunity to explore computer science freely, without the pressure of grades, in a community of like-minded individuals. I chose to use this time to work with a partner to create a music production tool that generates wave-tables to be used as synths by recording the reaction of photons passing through liquid undergoing stochastic or human-generated motion, calling it WavePool. Throughout my journey at GHP, I learned a new low-level programming language (C), more about audio and sound manipulation, and worked with the conversion of raw sensor data into something usable.
