**Background:** Having a friend with an interest in cryptography and security, I wanted to create the perfect birthday present.

This project generates a new code every 30 seconds using a preshared key and the current time (which is kept track of using the real-time clock module) and displays it on the display when the button is pressed. The most common use case would be two-factor verification based on Time-based One Time Password (TOTP) and HMAC-based One Time Password (HOTP) for authentication.
