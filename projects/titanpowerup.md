**Background:** Titan PowerUp is a 2D mobile game available on both iOS and Android which [Berkan Ottlik](https://berkan.xyz) and I developed during our freshmen year of high school.

Blinky has lost itself in the 8-bit world of FIRSTÂ® POWER UPâ„ . You must help Blinky escape by jumping your way out.

* Simple, innovative, addictive gameplay
* Jump through obstacles
* Use actual Powerups
* Enter autonomous mode
* And so much more...
