**Background:** I have wanted to make an audio mixer for a long time now, but I couldn't find one that would get two channels from one audio jack, so I made this. This mixer is passive, meaning it doesn't need power and it can be configured in Virtual DJ as an external mixer with a stereo to mono splitter.
