Ascent is a compact, wrist-worn device that uses an EMG sensor and an ESP8266 microcontroller to provide real-time feedback on forearm muscle contractions, aiding climbers in optimizing grip strength and endurance.\
\
Ascent's uniqueness lies in its ability to provide real-time, data-driven feedback on a climber's grip technique by directly measuring forearm muscle contractions, which is not commonly found in other climbing aids, potentially increasing safety and improving performance.
