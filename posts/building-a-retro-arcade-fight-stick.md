Having recently gotten into a retro-style fighting game called [Guilty Gear -Strive-](https://www.guiltygear.com/ggst/en/), I decided I wanted to try playing with a fight stick. After doing some price comparisons, I decided the cheapest and most easily upgradeable option was to build my own arcade stick.

Using [parts](https://www.microcenter.com/product/645997/universal-arcade-control-kit-black) from Micro Center ($20), a wooden box from Michaels ($6), and using the standard Japanese arcade button layout from [slagcoin](https://www.slagcoin.com/joystick/layout.html), I threw together a surprisingly nice arcade stick.

Looking forward, I will likely swap out the joystick and buttons for a [Sanwa](https://www.amazon.com/Sanwa-Denshi-JLF-TP-8YTFAST-SHIPPING-Adjustable/dp/B01CRQMWEQ) joystick with [Seimitsu](https://arcadeshock.com/collections/seimitsu-30mm-buttons) buttons.
