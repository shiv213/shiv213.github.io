Getting serious about climbing this summer led a climbing buddy and me to try and make our own [Beastmaker](https://www.beastmaker.co.uk/collections/fingerboards) fingerboard on a budget. Made this using outdoor pressure-treated 2x6 board and a router + circular saw. The FingerForge logo was etched on by placing the whole board into a [Glowforge](https://glowforge.com/).
